# &nbsp;
I am a final-year Ph.D. candidate in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Cornell University. I am currently in the job market. 
I am interested in architecture and cyber-physical systems security using machine learning and formal methods.
For machine learning for security, I explored the usage of ML for automated HW vulnerability discovery. I proposed to use machine learning to infer the location of autonomous vehicles via  [cache side channel](pub/sec20-luo.pdf) 
For formal method, I worked on a project that leveraged [information flow control](pub/ifc-cpsspc2018.pdf) to prevent untrusted sensor inputs from taking over the control of the vehicles. 



### Education

* Doctor of Philosophy, Computer Engineering, Cornell University, 2022 (expected).

* Master of Science, Computer Science, University of California San Diego, 2017.

* Bachelor of Science, Microelectronics, Peking University, 2014.

### Research

My current main research direction is the security of computer architecture and cyber-physical systems, using machine learning, information flow, and trusted execution environments. In the past, I have been working on electronic design automation research at UC San Diego. Long before that, when I was an undergrad at Peking Univerity back in China, I have also worked on device physics research.
