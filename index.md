I am a final-year Ph.D. candidate in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Cornell University. I am currently in the job market. 
I am interested in architecture and cyber-physical systems security using machine learning and formal methods.
For machine learning for security, I explored the usage of ML for automated HW vulnerability discovery. I proposed to use machine learning to infer the location of autonomous vehicles via  [cache side channel](pub/sec20-luo.pdf) 
For formal method, I worked on a project that leveraged [information flow control](pub/ifc-cpsspc2018.pdf) to prevent untrusted sensor inputs from taking over the control of the vehicles.
