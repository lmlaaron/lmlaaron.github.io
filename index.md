I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Cornell University. I do research on hardware security for cyber-physical systems and autonomous driving. I worked on a project that leveraged [information flow control](pub/ifc-cpsspc2018.pdf) to prevent untrusted sensor inputs from taking over the control of the vehicles. I demonstrated for the first time that [cache side channel](pub/sec20-luo.pdf) can be used to infer the location of autonomous vehicles, which is a serious security threat. I am advised by [Prof. G. Edward Suh](https://tsg.ece.cornell.edu/people/g-edward-suh/).
