Mulong Luo is a fourth-year Ph.D. student at Cornell University. His thesis topic is on hardware security for cyber-physical systems and autonomous driving. He has been working on several projects on the autonomous driving safety and security issues from hardware aspect. He worked on a project that leveraged [information flow control](pub/ifc-cpsspc2018.pdf) to prevent untrusted sensor inputs from taking over the control of the vehicles. He demonstrated for the first time that [cache side channel](pub/sec20-luo.pdf) can be used to infer the location of autonomous vehicles, which is a serious security threat. He is advised by [Prof. G. Edward Suh](https://tsg.ece.cornell.edu/people/g-edward-suh/).
