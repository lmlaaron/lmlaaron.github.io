My current main research direction is the security of computer architecture and cyber-physical systems, using machine learning, information flow, and trusted execution environments. In the past, I have been working on electronic design automation research at UC San Diego. Long before that, when I was an undergrad at Peking Univerity back in China, I have also worked on device physics research.
