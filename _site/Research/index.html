<p>My current main research direction is the security of cyber-physical systems and autonomous vehicles. I aim at using principled software and hardware methods to address the security issues of real-world cyber-physical systems. In the past, I have been working on electronic design automation at UC San Diego. Long before that, when I was an undergrad in China, I have also worked on device physics.</p>
